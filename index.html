  <p>Climate Change is any long-term change of the Earth's global weather patterns or average temperatures. This is usually because of greenhouse gases, which are types of gas in the air that trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere like a blanket. There are some natural causes, but they either have very little effect or happen over very many years. You can see some of those natural causes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-earths-climate-changes-naturally-and-why-things-are-different-now-20200721/">HERE.</a> The human causes of Climate Change are much more of a problem. Human causes include:</p>
  <ul style="width: 400px; float: right; margin-right: 150px">
    <li>Power Generation via Fossil Fuels</li>
    <li>Deforestation</li>
    <li>Transportation of Gas-Powered Vehicles</li>
    <li>Manufacturing</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top:100px">Climate Change has resulted in many harmful effects to the Earth. The Earth has become much hotter, so many areas have been experiencing heatwaves and wildfires. The weather has became much more severe, with powerful, frequent storms, and dry, destructive droughts. 
    <br><br>The ocean absorbs much of the heat and carbon dioxide in the air. This has caused polar ice caps to melt, which raises the sea level and lessens habitat space for animals in arctic locations. Additionally, the raised sea level threatens communities that live on the coast or on islands, as their space is also receding as the sea level rises. Increased carbon dioxide in the oceans has made them more acidic.

  <p>While what is said above may sound scary, remember that it's never over before it's over. We can slow down climate change if we work together and all do little things to reduce carbon use. Even if you aren't a world leader or in a position of power, you can still chip in.
    <br><br>Carbon is mostly used when energy is generated by fossil fuels, gas-powered engines are used, or plastics are being made. Turning off lights or electronics you aren't currently using, as well as switching to more energy efficient electronics such as LED lightbulbs will reduce energy usage.
    <br><br>You can reduce use of gas engines by using energy efficient vehicles, such as a hybrid or electric car. If you can't access either of those, you can carpool, use public transport, or use a bicycle to reduce the total amount of engines used.
    <br><br>Another important thing to do is to reduce, reuse, recycle. Not only does it lessen the amount of trash in the world, it lessens climate change by reducing the energy used to produce plastics. Things like reusable bags or utensils are common options.
